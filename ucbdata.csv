Whenever they ask a question, no one ever responds. Yeah so I didn't do any math competitions or whatever in high school, but for some reason no math class I took I enjoyed.

"I'm a a straight male, and I'm completely disinterested in relationships right now. Yeah, being accepted sexually is something I aspire to one day, but I cannot fathom why most of my friends are looking forward THIS fucking much to getting a gorlfriend. I watch many straight dudes struggle to bend to their woman's every whim just so they can see nude tits. Like, we are all busy students trying to get work done, yet you still manage to force yourself to accept everything she says and does no matter how much it goes against your own convictions. I get it, we're the vegan [REDACTED] generation, but dude, have you even thought of an action plan if you wake up one day and she suddenly turns on you because of something she saw on Overheard at Berkeley? Even if someone is actively going out of their way to make my life ""better"", NO, I cannot put my values and my dreams below others' just for the female form. To be honest, going out of your way to appease me reeks of entrapment, especially given how many times people who I used to trust suddenly scapegoated me for shit I didn't do because of swirling rumors from their dance group's vice president or whoever. I wanted to get a 5th year's Masters here but I need to straight up get out of all this bullshit at Berkeley, and hearing the words ""I love you"" definitely aren't worth the stresses of potentially lying next to a sleeper cell for my social adversaries.

"Okay nothing has worked for me so I have to confess this here. About a week ago I was just playing my with my clit watching a punishteen video. It was a typical girl getting dominated thing. But just at the moment when I was about to climax the girl said ""Daddy"" very loudly for some reason, while throughout the entire video she was saying it very softly. This caught me off by surprise and the image of the actual dad popped up in my head. So for the full 10-15 seconds of my climax I had my actual father even though I looked at the screen trying to get the image away. After I climaxed , I felt really weird so I thought about it for some time. So, next time I thought I would just watch regular porn and it wouldn't happen again. But the next time I got scared even before I started watching thinking it would happen again. The anxiety took over, and I couldn't do it, my dad appearing over and over again for no reason. It was really annoying me and it kept on happening every time I tried to get some sexy alone time. I've tried multiple things like watching all kinds of porn, looking at the screen intensely to get the image away but it just doesn't happen. I don't know what to do. Does this happen normally?

"I really wish I could ignore my morals for a second. Why not just get back together with my ex? Why not just hook up with the girl next door even though she has a boyfriend? Why not just say all the fuck you's I've been dying to let out? Probably not a good idea, but a man can dream, right? P.S. Girl next door, if you're reading this, I actually just think you're really cool and want to be your friend and read books and drink tea together and shit.",-0.662276,0.591299,0.629382,0.110173,0.124978,0.535373

"One thing I know about myself is that I AM attracted to guys who are kind of shitty to me. Not like abusive or anything, but guys who just seem hard to please. I can’t help it, it’s like some flip switches in my brain and it makes me crazy over them. But I’m seeing someone who’s so nice to me so I want to try really hard to make it work and give him a chance. I hate that I’m perpetuating the idea that girls like assholes so I’m trying to change myself. Nice guys out there, don’t get any ideas and turn into assholes",-0.869584,0.17673,0.652715,0.098433,0.126407,0.646467
"As someone in the Greek system, fuck any guy who tries to get bids without bringing any/only bringing one or two girls. The fuck kind of incel virgin are you? Is it fucking impossible to get an equal amount or more girls to come? It pisses me off too because as frat bros, we put a ton of work into these parties. Y'all don't even fucking understand the logistics and the hours that go into these things. And for some beta cuck with no female friends to try and sneak himself into this honestly feels disrespectful. We put in work to make this lit, you fucking should too. Get over yourself. There's only a few guys I'd give bids to without any girls. You're not one of them. Grow a fucking pair and talk to women, or give up your spot for someone who can.",-0.866503,0.092612,0.442053,0.083027,0.526851,0.647004
"I'm Asian-American. I feel very disconnected both from my Asian heritage and the expected Asian-American background. I grew up in a pretty white (but still relatively diverse) area and I have stereotypically ""white,"" interests. Yes, I love dad rock, listen to NPR, went camping all the time as a child, and cannot relate to a lot of what constitutes the Asian-American ""background."" I dislike boba, anime, raves, and coordinated dancing, and have zero interest in participating in any Asian subcultures. I respect them fully but they're just not my cup of tea. Obviously the things I listed are pretty shallow, but what it comes down to is just that I feel like my race does not make up any of my identity whatsoever. This isn't meant to be a ""I'm-not-like-the-other-Asians,"" post. However, coming to Berkeley it almost feels like I'm expected to adhere to my racial group and background. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it or if it's very real; I know I definitely did not feel this way in my hometown. I feel like all the Asians stick together here, and if you don't relate to Asian-American or Asian culture it's difficult to feel like you fit in. I've been told by others half a dozen times that I don't ""look"" like a typical Asian either -- my features, the way I dress, etc. and I feel like (I'm not sure if I'm imagining this or not) sometimes other Asians don't want to associate with me just because of that. I'll walk into a room and get glares. I just hate that because I'm Asian there are all these preconceived notions about me that I don't fit. I don't fit in anywhere here. It's driving me a little crazy because again, I'm not sure if I'm just imagining it, or if it's very real. I've also virtually never experienced the racism that most Asian-Americans complain about. I don't mean this to be an erasure of other people's experiences; I believe them entirely, I'm just often curious as to why I in particular have, for example, never experienced Asian fetishization despite dating many white or latino men. None of them have ever made a pointed comment about my race. And honestly, when it comes to dating, I'm grateful to be in America. People here always complain that one beauty standard is promoted here, but it's far worse in Asia, where you have to be 80 pounds, pale as shit, and have the same exact set of facial features -- a standard I definitely don't fit. I've literally never been called pretty or been approached by an Asian or Asian-American in my life, but I get told that I am all the time from men of other races. Here in Berkeley, it makes me write off Asian men, not because I'm not into them, but because I feel like they aren't attracted or interested in me at all. So I don't relate to most of the Asian-American heritage, background, or struggles, and it makes me feel like an outsider all the time in Berkeley where it feels like people are obsessed with race. I'm almost scared of being accused of some form of racism for this confession. I'm not sure if anyone else feels the same way, but if they do, I hope this post helps them realize that they're not alone. And it feels nice to get this off my chest.",-0.632379,0.53851,0.574526,0.128436,0.135733,0.535165
