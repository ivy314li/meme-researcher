"""When I finally decided to leave my abusive ex-boyfriend, I lost a lot of weight and got really depressed. I am so much better and happier now, doing better in every other aspect, except I can’t get my weight back up. I hate how I’ve lost so much weight. Even my breasts look different and like they have excess skin. Has anyone had this problem or does anyone have an idea of building a body after extreme weight loss? I’m so insecure. I feel like I won’t ever want to have sex again because I can’t find a solution aside from surgery."""

"""What really bothers me is how people are simply killing animals all the time. Like why? I find it so stupid how people go out killing animals when there's an animal attack. For example, we see a shark attack and then the next few years, we start going out there and hunting sharks. Sharks don't even attack humans on purpose. First of all, you're in their fucking territory and they have the right to defend themselves and home. Don't fucking expect the animals to not defend their homes when you're fucking in their territory. We fucking have the right to shoot people for being in our property like the fucking wild animals that we are but when an animal is doing the same exact thing, it's fucking like the world is going to end. Second of all, most animals are fucking curious so they ""nibble"" and sometimes it just so fucking happens that it's labelled as an ""attack"". Dogs fucking come up and sniff for curiosity or they fucking teeth and we think it's cute. Sorry sharks don't fucking come up to you and poke you with their fins as curiosity. Their way of being curious is having a nibble; they're just strong jaws. That's why people in fucking cages when shark diving get ""attacked"". Sharks don't know what the fuck is that thing doing in the water and they want to know. We are allowed to just waltz into any fucking animal territory and study their homes and behavior how ever we like because of curiosity without thinking about invading their territory. There's fucking 16 annual shark attacks and 1 fatal shark attack EVERY. TWO. FUCKING. YEARS. You have a higher chance of dying to a fucking bullet ant than a shark. What's with people killing animals and poaching?!?!? Who in the right fucking mind looks into an animals eyes and fucking start cutting their horns off? That's like having other fucking people coming up to you and taking your fucking organs and selling it for money, which is the fucking black market organ trade. That's so fucking wrong but you're doing the same exact shit to animals but because we're on the top of the food chain or we are a more advanced organism living in this fucking world, it gives us the right to fucking do that to other animals but when it's done to us, it's fucking war. Don't fucking get mad at me and say shit like ""there's people out there who do good for these animals"". Yea no shit, there's people out there but there's also fucking good cops our there but all we fucking remember is those police officers who shoot black people just because they can. It's because we're wearing a uniform that represent the human race and there's fucking a lot of people who are out there making these adorable and loving animals go extinct. This is why I wish there's more diseases like cancer and the bubonic plague to fucking kill more humans; we're over populating this fucking world anyway and killing other animals just to sustain our selfish asses. Yea, say what if my family members get cancer? Honestly, that's just how life goes and it sucks. I'm willing to exchange 2.53 billion people for all the animals that aren't SUPPOSED to go extinct and have them back. It fucking sucks thinking how there's only 2 FUCKING NORTHERN WHITE RHINOS LEFT. It fucking sucks how some of us will never know how a fucking gorilla, tigers, sea turtles, orangutans, elephants, rhinos, or even saolas look like because we're too busy fucking killing other animals to keep ourselves alive. Don't give me crap about this is just survival of the fittest. These animals belong here and they are the reason why we have life on this shitty planet. I'm tired of seeing people treating other living things like shit. I'm tired of seeing people not know what belongs in the fucking trash or recycle or compost. I'm tired of dumb-ass people who are fucking in college and still don't know how to act as a fucking decent human being. People like that are a fucking waste of space and deserve to die. I wish the worse for them. Thank you for listening to my ted talk."""

"""I'm someone who has trouble making friends and I was lucky enough to make friends with my roomates. It started off quite well, hangouts etc. I'm admit that I can be a bit dumb at times and my roommates caught on. Coming into 2nd quarter they started teasing me for it and I played it off as a joke. That's how it started off as a joke. It escalated pretty quickly where there is not a day that goes by where they didn't make fun of me. I feel like I'm middle school all over agian and it fuckin sucks. Everyone else in our friend group noticed it to and questioned them on why they are doing this. Their explanation was that ""it's just what friends do"". They even brag about it like that is how ""close"" we are because I can ""stand"" it. Really though, I got to the point where I'm discourage to even talk to them, in fear of saying something wrong or dumb and have them just go off on me. I hate being in dorm because they're there and after they go off on me I just leave the dorm for hours and act like I'm studying. I cry here and there because of them because I just feel like I'm being bullied in fucking college like I was in throughout my childhood. The one time they caught me crying, they said ""it's just joke, why are you crying"". I'm know they good people but I wish they were more considerate. I'm scared to tell them what I feel about them, since I will probably be told that I'm to sensitive( I've always been told that) and dont know how to take a joke. I living with them next year and I dont think my mental state cant handle it anymore. I feel like I'm trapped because all of my friends are also their friends and I have no one to talk to."""
